# Employment-Portal

Project Description:
Many employment portals are available for jobs in IT sectors, marketing sectors, education sectors and so on. India has millions of small scale businesses that are in need of employees. With JobDekho.com, we would like to introduce this technology to the people wanting to find jobs in non-technical sectors and small scale industries as well. For example, a small catering business wanting to hire a few cooks and a delivery person. This platform aims to connect employers with rightly skilled people and benefit these businesses as a part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat program.

Tech Stack:
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
Back-end: Python (Flask)
Database: SQLite3

Purpose/aim of the project:

To provide an employment portal for non-technical sectors and small scale businesses.
To improve India's economy by helping boost local businesses by helping enhance the hiring process.
To provide a user friendly platform that's easy to use and that makes the job-seekers aware of the different employment opportunities around them.
To implement an effective website that enables employers to find the right people for any specific job, thus making the process of hiring easier.
Features:

We have two kinds of accounts on this website- one for a job-seeker and the other for an employer.
With a job-seeker account, one can search for jobs based on skill set or on the job location.
With an employer account, one can create a job, view the applicants of the various jobs created and hire any job-seeker.
